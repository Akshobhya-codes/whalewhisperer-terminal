# 🐳 WhaleWhisperer – Social Voice-Trading Game

### Make friends. Build groups. Outsmart the market (and your buddies).

**WhaleWhisperer** turns meme-coin trading into a **multiplayer, voice-driven competition**.  
Use your voice to buy, sell, and roast — then watch your P/L move on the **group leaderboard** as you battle friends for the top spot.

## 🌊 Core Idea

A *social trading arena* where:
- Every player starts with $10 000 virtual USD.  
- You trade six original, volatile meme coins by voice.  
- Each trade instantly updates your **portfolio, P/L, and rank**.  
- You can form **friend groups**, spectate each other, and launch mini-tournaments.  
- The AI whale cheers winners and roasts losers — all through real speech.
